## Tiny Habits

1. **Question 1** - In the video "Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg," the most interesting idea for me was the concept of starting with tiny habits and letting them grow naturally.

2. **Question 2** - B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To make new habits easier, we can break it down as follows:
   - M (Motivation): Increase motivation by attaching the habit to an existing behavior or finding intrinsic motivation.
   - A (Ability): Make the habit easy to do by breaking it down into smaller steps or adjusting the environment to support the habit.
   - P (Prompt): Use prompts or cues to remind yourself to perform the habit at the appropriate time.

3. **Question 3** - It is important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit because celebrating reinforces the behavior and makes it more likely to become a habit. When we associate positive emotions with a habit, our brain is more inclined to repeat it.

4. **Question 4** - In the video "1% Better Every Day," the most interesting idea for me was the concept of making small improvements consistently over time.

5. **Question 5** - In the book summary of "Atomic Habits," the perspective about Identity is that habits are deeply tied to our identity. Changing habits requires changing our beliefs about ourselves and adopting the identity of the person who performs the desired habits.

6. **Question 6** - The book's perspective on making a habit easier to do involves making it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. This can be achieved by designing the environment to cue the habit, making it appealing, breaking it down into smaller steps, and rewarding yourself for completing it.

7. **Question 7** - To make a habit harder to do, the book suggests making it invisible, unattractive, difficult, or unsatisfying. This can be done by removing cues that trigger the habit, associating negative consequences with the habit, increasing the effort required to perform it, or implementing penalties for engaging in the habit.

**Reflection:**

8. **Question 8** - One habit I would like to do more of is exercising daily. To make it more attractive and easy, I can:
   - Place my workout clothes and shoes next to my bed as a visual cue.
   - Set a specific time for exercise each day.
   - Reward myself with a healthy snack or some relaxing time after completing the workout.

9. **Question 9** - One habit I would like to eliminate or do less of is procrastinating. To make it less attractive and harder, I can:
   - Remove distractions like my phone or computer during work hours.
   - Break the habit down into smaller steps and tackle them one at a time.
   - Implement a consequence for each instance of procrastination, such as donating to a charity for each hour wasted.
